# Event Management System
**Event Management System** used in our projects. Has been copied/stolen from one of **Unite talks**.

## Getting Started

1. Open up project packages manifest JSON: [Project Folder]/Packages/manifest.json
2. Add following line on top of **dependencies**: `"net.dynamicbox.eventmanagement": "https://github.com/mechaniqe/event-management.git",`

The end result should be similar to:
```
{
  "dependencies": {
    "net.dynamicbox.eventmanagement": "https://github.com/mechaniqe/event-management.git",
    ...
  }
}
```
